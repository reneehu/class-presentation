Who are your adversaries? These might include hackers, script kiddies, hactivists (to achieve some political cause), computer criminals (hacking for profit or financial gain), virus and worm writers, insiders and, last but not least, cyberterrorists targeting critical infrastructure and using attacks as a force multiplier.
What are the targets? These might include information, computer and network resources, enterprise infrastructure and hardware. Some physical vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access to these targets include unlocked doors and cabinets, exposed systems and network links, fragile power sources, limited video surveillance and monitoring, and poor authentication. System vulnerabilities include the infamous unsecured or default "guest" account, ad hoc trust relationships between systems, poor access controls, limited authentication and nonrepudiation facilities, collocation of systems, and unknown and untracked remote access points. (Not knowing your security perimeter is a disaster waiting to happen.)
