                        </p>
                        <p class="left-align">An example would be the recent ransomware attacks on a string of Medical Facilities namely: Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California. The impact to these hospitals technology infrastructure were significant as it required them to shut down all of their desktop computers & activate a back-up systems, as well as limit access to web-based services and electronic communications. Some of these hospitals were not able to access critical data and were forced to pay, in order to retrieve / re-gain access to files. <i><a style="color:#ffffff" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35880610"> *source* </a></i>

                        <p class="left-align">Another form or electronic disruption to websites are DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, where in multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted systems, thereby making it unavailable to actual users who would like to conduct transactions.
