                        <p class="left-align">P2P lending refers to the borrowing and lending activity through online platform. The lenders get attracted since they make more interests comparing with saving money in the band while on the other hand, borrowers can get an easy loan with easier approvals. These loans can be differentiated to two categories, either secured loans or unsecured loans. Secured loans require the borrower offer assets as collateral, which can be real estate, luxury assets and other kinds of property. Unsecured loans will not have certain requirement but are with higher APR since there’s higher risk that the lender cannot get the fund back. P2PL platform, as a third party, functions as a broker within those transactions. A certain portion of interests will be earned by them and also the borrowers need to pay a fee to get listed on the website.

                        <p class="left-align">Ezubao, one of the biggest P2PL website, started in 2014 and shut down in Feb 2016 by the government for Ponzi scheme. By the year end of 2015, Ezubao has raised 74.5 billion RMB from more than 900,000 investors. Only 4.2 billion RMB got paid back. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="left-align">The Ponzi scheme of Ezubao starts here. To attract lenders, Ezubao offers high APR financial products varies from 9% to 14.6%, which is much higher than saving money in bank. Ezubao fakes borrowers’ names and sign contracts with lenders. Money has been sent to their account through online banking. At the same time, Ezubao expands their sales team which is able to cover 31 provinces in China. With high APR and good sales people, lenders started purchasing their financial products. Ezubao is using new lenders’ money to pay back old lenders. When lenders find they can get paid at the ending date on the contract, they start to have trust with Ezubao, then purchase bigger amount of their product. Ezubao uses part of raised funds to pay old contracts, the remaining has used on developing their sales and shared between their management team. This lasts one and a half years, until their high speed expand slows down in year end of 2015. When money collected from new lenders cannot satisfy existing contracts, their funding strand finally breaks. Since Ezubao is not making any profit, their debt grows bigger and bigger. It’s impossible for them to pay all contracts. Their management team start escaping from China and later got caught.

                        <p class="left-align">E-commerce offers everybody a convenience way to do business. But on the other hand, since everything is through Internet, it’s hard to monitor the management for both users and government. In China, 200 P2PL companies shut down in year end 2015 for faking borrowers and using money on their own.
